Waiting by Kevin Henkes

An owl, a pig, a dog, a bear, and a rabbit are toys waiting on a windowsill. But what are they waiting for? The owl waits for the moon (I assume this is because he is nocturnal). The pig is holding an umbrella and it’s waiting for the rain. The bear is holding a kite and waiting for the wind. The puppy on the sled is waiting for the snow to fall. The real star of the show, the rabbit with the stars, isn’t waiting for anything in particular. The book uses pastel colours to highlight the theme that happiness can be found in the simplicity that life brings us- all we need to do is wait. ‘Waiting’ doesn’t shy away from difficult concepts, as it explores death and grief. The windowsill toys have a new addition, an Indian elephant, which they regard with awe. However, the next page reveals that the elephant falls and breaks, meeting its untimely demise. While the windowsill toys go through different weather conditions as seasons pass, each toy has its own reign of happiness. As we do in life, seasons that favor us, and seasons that just pass as we wait for a better time to arrive. The rabbit stands out as he is always waiting at the window, but never for anything in particular. He is content with waiting. Let us hope we are all as content with waiting as him.
