<p>Hello! My name is Azka Bukhari, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a diverse background in teaching and programming. Over the last two years, I have dedicated myself to learning and immersing myself in the fascinating world of cybersecurity. </p>

I believe that a strong grasp of the basics is essential for anyone looking to excel in cybersecurity. </p>
